    "text": "Course Description\nStatistics is the science of collecting, manipulating, and analyzing empirical data. In this class, we will learn the statistical fundamentals that will enable us to draw conclusions about the environment and its interaction with social and economic systems. We will cover fundamental statistical concepts and tools, and then apply and expand upon those tools to learn some temporal and spatial statistical methods that are particularly helpful in environmental data science. Welcome!\n\nSome concepts we’ll cover:\n\nSampling and study design, descriptive statistics\nLinear and logistic regression (univariate and multivariate)\nHypothesis testing and inference\nSpatial weighting, spatial clustering\nTime series analysis, forecasting"

Please write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) describing the project you propose to pursue. Motivate the question, describe possible data sources, and suggest possible analyses you may conduct to answer your question. Submission will be through Canvas.\nTechnical blog post [Due date: 12/13, 11:59 pm]. This blog post is a write up summarizing in text and with figures and/or tables your question, the data you have collected, your analysis plan, and your results. Your target audience should be other quantitative scientists and practitioners familiar with the basics of statistics and data science, but not necessarily experts in environmental science or the details of the methods studied in this course. Submit a link to your blog post via Canvas by 11:59pm on December 13.\n\nSome guidelines for the blog post:\n\nMain text length should be roughly 1500 - 2500 words.\n2-4 tables and/or figures, each carefully labeled and captioned so that they are easily interpretable\nInclude scientific references when applicable.\nInclude links to the underlying data you use. If your data cannot be shared publicly, note this in a short “data availability” statement at the end of your post.\nInclude a link to a repository with your code.\n\n\n4-minute presentation [December 10 8-11am]. This is a short presentation for the class in which you motivate your question, describe your data and analysis plan, and summarize your results. It should be a fun way to practice sharing data science with an audience through public speaking.\nIn order to fit everyone in, the 4-minute limit will have to be strictly enforced. Practice your presentation in advance and time yourself! 4 minutes is probably much, much shorter than you think."

If helpful, you can use a histogram, scatterplot, or summary statistics table to describe your data.\nClearly describe your analysis plan. What is your analysis plan? Why did you choose this analysis, given your data and question? What are the limitations?\nSummarize your results visually and in words. Show us your results in figure(s) and/or table(s) that are carefully labeled and captioned. Describe in the text (and orally when presenting) what you found, and how these results either do or do not help you answeryour question.\nWhat might you do next?
